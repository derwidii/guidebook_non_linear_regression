This thesis has provided a practical guide to nonlinear regression, bridging the gap between theory and application. The central finding is that the enduring value of nonlinear regression lies in its profound interpretability. In an era dominated by black-box algorithms, the ability to use mechanistic models in which parameters represent tangible quantities (such as reaction rates or carrying capacities) is indispensable. These models allow researchers to test scientific theories and gain insight into underlying processes, a crucial advantage that distinguishes them from purely predictive methods.

From a practical standpoint, this investigation identified the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm as the most robust and reliable optimization method, consistently converging adequately where other algorithms fail. LM particularly shows the best reliabilityâ€“accuracy trade-off under poor starts. This was complemented by the effectiveness of self-starting functions, which automate the critical step of finding initial parameter estimates, making analyses more accessible and trustworthy.

However, these findings come with limitations. The evaluations herein relied on a curated set of well-behaved models using clean, synthetic data. Real-world data, with its characteristic outliers and complex error structures, presents a more formidable challenge. Future work should therefore focus on validating these methods on messy, empirical datasets to test their true limits. Furthermore, a more exhaustive investigation into the synergy between specific initialization techniques and optimization algorithms would be a valuable contribution. In addition, this study does not assess small-sample bias of NLS estimators in strongly nonlinear settings, which can be non-negligible and is linked to model curvature. Finally, while parameter correlation was explored using correlation matrices and profile-t methods, a deeper investigation into formal curvature diagnostics and reparameterization strategies to mitigate collinearity remains a fruitful area for future work.

In conclusion, nonlinear regression occupies a unique and powerful niche. While the allure of more flexible, model-agnostic methods is strong, they cannot replace the inferential depth offered by theory-driven models. When armed with robust tools like the LM algorithm, researchers are well-equipped to understand complex relationships, not just predict them. Ultimately, the choice between these approaches depends on the primary goal of the analysis: to understand or merely to forecast. For the pursuit of scientific understanding, nonlinear regression remains an essential ally.
