# Abstract {.unnumbered}

This thesis provides a comprehensive guide to nonlinear regression, bridging the gap between foundational theory and practical application. It systematically addresses the entire modeling workflow, including parameter estimation, model diagnostics, and statistical inference. Through comparative evaluations in a simulation-based environment, the thesis identifies the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm as offering the best trade-off between accuracy, speed, and reliability, and demonstrates the superior accuracy of profile-t intervals over simpler Wald-based as well as bootstrap approaches, especially in cases of high nonlinearity or small sample sizes.

Key applications in biology (Gompertz growth), economics (Cobb–Douglas function), and pharmacology (Hill equation) illustrate how to handle common challenges such as autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. The work also explores advanced topics, including robust regression for outlier-contaminated data, mixed-effects models for hierarchical data, and a comparison with flexible alternatives like neural networks. The central conclusion emphasizes that the enduring value of nonlinear regression lies in its interpretability, where model parameters correspond to meaningful scientific quantities, making it an indispensable tool for testing theories and gaining insight into underlying processes.
